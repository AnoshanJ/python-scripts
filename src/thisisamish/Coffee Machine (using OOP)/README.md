# Coffee Machine with OOP

The program has been written using OOP concepts so you will find a `main.py` file with its three dependencies - `coffee_maker.py`, `menu.py` and `money_machine.py`.

<br>

As the names suggest, `main.py` is the entry point in the point in the program. Then, `menu.py` handles the menu of the coffee machine, `coffee_maker.py` handles the actual making of the coffee, and `money_machine.py` handles the price and validation of the money entered by the user.

<br>

The Coffee Machine can be operated using just a few commands:
1. "report" would give you a report of all the resources in the coffee machine.
2. "off" will shut off the coffee machine program.
3. "latte", "espresso" and "cappuccino" are the actual coffee types you can enter.
