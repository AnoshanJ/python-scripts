# Binarysearch
- This algorithm is used to search for an element in a sorted array.
- The element entered by the user is compared with the middle element in the array.
- If this element matches with the element in the array , then the position of the middle element is displayed.
-  If the element entered is greater than the middle element, then element can only lie in the right half of the array.The algorithm is applied again for the right half.
- Else if the element entered is smaller, the target element must lie in the left half.So,the algorithm is applied for the left half.
