# Contributing

Contributing to this project is very much easy.

To contibute, open an issue describing the code you want to add to the repository
then, wait to be assigned (Less than a day).

Then create a folder in the src folder with your github username. Inside this folder, create
another folder with the name of the issue you want to solve.

Additionally, make sure to add a README describing your project and it's dependencies. [See a README example](https://github.com/theadeyemiolayinka/python-scripts/blob/main/src/Dellucifer/Colour-Detection-CV/README.md)

Also, add a requirements.txt file to make installation easier

Feel free to give the project a star.

# Example
If I want to add a python script for basic addition
I would create an issue stating so after assignment, I would 
create `src/theadeyemiolayinka/addition/main.py`, `src/theadeyemiolayinka/addition/README.md` and `src/theadeyemiolayinka/addition/requirements.txt`

Where `theadeyemiolayinka` is my username and `addition` is my project name.
